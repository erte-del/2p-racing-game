extends Node3D

## Builds the two split-screen views.
##
## The cars live here, in the main scene, so they share one World3D and can
## collide with each other. Each SubViewport inherits that same world and
## contributes only its own camera, which is what makes split screen work
## without duplicating the level.

## Visual layers carrying each player's private overlay. Because both halves
## of the screen render the same world, anything on these layers has to be
## culled by the other player's camera or it shows up in both views.
